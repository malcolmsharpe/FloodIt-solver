Some simple cases where the easy-to-compute heuristic does not match optimal value.
(The input format might be wrong.)

Depth-2:

....BGR
....BBB
.......
RRR.GGG
BGR.GBR

opt = 5
heur
  0 3
  1 4
  2 3


Just 2 clumps:

RGR.BGR

opt = 4
heur
  0 3
  1 3
  2 3
  3 3


Note: 3 colours really are necessary for these examples, because the heuristic always matches the
optimal value for just 2 colours. TODO: Actually prove this. Should be easy because 2-colour
solutions are always alternating.
